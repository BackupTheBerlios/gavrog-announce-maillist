Subject: [Gavrog-announce] Gavrog 0.4.0 released
Message-ID: <4917BBD6.3080801@gmail.com>

Dear friends of Gavrog,

I am happy to announce a new release today, which contains Systre
version 1.1.5 and 3dt version 0.4.0. It introduces several bug fixes,
updates and improvements, as well as a few new features. Upgrading is
highly recommended.

To download, please go to http://www.gavrog.org and follow the link at
the top of the page.

Highlights:

- Systre optionally processes files without stopping between entries.

- 3dt handles two-dimensional tilings, displays ball-and-stick
   representations of a tiling's underlying net, and had a major
   overhaul of its user interface.

For a full list of changes, see the change log.

Please note that there is no longer a separate download for the Systre
executable.


Cheers,
Olaf
